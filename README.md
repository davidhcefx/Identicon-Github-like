# Identicon Generator (Github-like)

An [Identicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) is an icon that contains a hash value representing part of your identity. Although it is not known how Github generates each user's Identicon, it is not too hard to make one.

For a 5x5 Github-like Identicon, observe that all of them are horizontally symmetric. That is, the pattern itself only contains
5\*3 = 15 bits of information.
